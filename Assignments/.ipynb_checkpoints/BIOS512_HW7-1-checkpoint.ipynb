This relates to the idea of committing a change to the history of our code because this patch file consists of all the changes that were made to a file.  And so, when committing a change, we are committing all the changes made to the working file to our local repository. Thus, both patches and commits utilize the idea of changes between two files to update different files."

On the other hand, a patch takes differences from one file to another and applies any changes from file one to two using the patch command.
