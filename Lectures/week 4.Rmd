Principles of effective visualization

Metric spaces and Dimensionality reduction

tsync --> lok at every point in our dataset,
 --> distribution of density (y) and distances between datapoints (x), and put into different dimensions, and see when these distances in each dimension match the og dimension. --> helps find the correlation between datapoints
 
 distrubution matrix --> diagnoal is 0;
 
 Rtsne takes in distance matrix directly with diff parameters
 ex: take the chemical names, when passed in through here, we get a graph showing relaitonship between the names as in all the scoids are next to one another, etc
